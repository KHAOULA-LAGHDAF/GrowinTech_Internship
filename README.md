During my one-month internship with GrowinTerm, I had the opportunity to engage in two significant tasks:

1. Movie Recommendation System: This project deepened my understanding of recommendation systems. I learned how to analyze, preprocess, and clean data effectively, which is crucial for building reliable models. Additionally, I gained hands-on experience with various techniques and libraries, including difflib for string matching and TfidfVectorizer for text representation, which helped in creating a more personalized movie recommendation experience.

2. Gender and Age Detection: In this task, I worked with powerful libraries such as OpenCV and DeepFace. These tools are exceptionally user-friendly and play a vital role in computer vision applications. I explored how they can be utilized for real-time gender and age detection, significantly enhancing my understanding of the practical applications of machine learning in image processing.
